PROJECT: Retail Sales Month-over-Month Change Flagging
AUTHOR: James Gifford
DESCRIPTION:
These queries identify months with significant month-over-month changes (greater than Â±5%) in sales across 
different retail categories using seasonally adjusted sales data. 

CONTEXT:
 - Large percentage changes reflect key market events, including the early COVID-19 impact (Mar-Apr 2020 shutdown)
  and subsequent economic reopening (May-Jun 2020).
 - Identifying these spikes/drops supports operational decision-making such as inventory planning and marketing.
 - Each query targets a specific sales category for granular insights.

 - Note: All sales figures in this analysis are expressed in millions of dollars.

 - These results confirmed the presence of extreme volatility in 2020,
 - supporting the decision to construct COVID-smoothed series before forecasting.
